# Week 7 Reflection

I think a lot of the construction kits mentioned on their own aren't creative. Specific kits from LEGO are made very custom fitted to be used to build very specific models and after that is done you cannot use them for much else. But a language like Scratch can be used openly for a lot of different creative subsets of art and design. The kit mentioned is kind of like a good combination of both of these where it allows a larger subset of variations possible, and I think it's a good way to encourage kids to be more creative and think about more possibilities. 

I like the learnable programming because it offers a unique perspective on what programming is and gives a way for non-programmers to be able to build things. I like the simplicity of how the author talks about steps of a program like steps in a recipe. Being able to see how it works definitely helps understand and write more logical code. In Drawing Brushes, it actually uses external drawings as inputs and gives the user the power to be able to create something that was already a limitation in some sense physically. It's almost an extension for an artist and I think the way the authors think about the procedural tool and how it can expand in development of an artists work, it's thought of more than how people think of procedural art and generation in games like No Man's Sky.
