# Week 5 Reflection

Bret talks about how the dynamic pictures can help tell a story that static pictures would just not be capable of. I definitely agree with this and I can already see this happening on a daily basis. I think for me the best example is the magazines and newspaper articles on Apple's platforms. They have the same articles and same magazines and yet most of them contain more dynamic images that help the viewer understand the article and what the author is trying to convey more. This is also true about many new web content. And it makes me think about how even at Apple a lot of artists did not have the ability to realize what might have been in their  ind, and needed someone to tranlate (code) it for them and be able to ship. There's a lot that can get lost with this process. 

I kind of disagree with the talk in a lot of ways, especially since Bret seems to contradict himself from the video vs the article. He talks about how artists aren't able to create anything ship-able apart from mock ups in photoshop and all those tools and have to rely on someone else. But then he talks about potential of software where a artist can interface directly with software without any code, which according to me is just a different limitation where artist might not be able to get what he has in mind out.
