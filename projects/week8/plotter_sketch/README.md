# Plotter Drawing 

I used shape primitives within Processing to draw my drawing to use with plotter. It was a long process of thinking if what I make would take too much time to plot vs if it would look good and if the plotter will be able to show the differences I wanted. Due to this I avoided having shading within my drawing that was in one of the earlier versions of my drawing. I really enjoyed using the plotter. Having never used a machine to draw for me (apart from a printer), seeing a machine that I physically interact with to change things was very unique.

I also really like how precise the drawing turned out to be. I think one of the largest downside with plotter was that colors needed to be manually changed, and there was a lot of space for user error. This self limited me to use simple designs rather than heavy vectorized ones. I also avoided using lines as I read that plotter will draw each line at a time, which seems true from how it drew the primitives one at a time instead of how a printer prints in a line sequence.
