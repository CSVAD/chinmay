# Week 7 Library Reflection

This library is a pretty simple library whose goal is to give the users the ability to draw some common abstract shapes that I saw during this quarter in class. Sometimes these shapes help a user create new designs or are just nice to look at honestly, and now using this library they can specify how big and where they;d like these shapes to be and then have the draw being handled by the library itself. 

The user currently has a couple exposed functions, making a snowflake, making a triangle that they can dynamically control and change based on user arguments and to draw a heart shape on the screen. Some of these are faily simple and some can be interesting to look at based on the changes being made in the library. All of these publically available functions also have associated examples with it. I decided to have a parent class that would have public functions that call deeper classes that inherit that class with wrappers. This way the user does not need to worry about what other sub-classes exist and rather make their usage faily simple. I choose this because having to use a new library can be difficult, and worrying about it's structure is just another issue that could have been avoided at this scale.
