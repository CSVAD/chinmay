# Final Project Proposal

~~For the final project, I would love to explore the generative artwork topic. I loved thinking about and researching all kinds of various artforms people have created using multiple stimulants as well as an array of technological tools including ML. Some of the artworks discussed in the class were very interesting to look at that used basic recursion as well as randomness to generate something beautiful. ~~

~~I'm interested in exploring something similar where I can provide a dataset of real world images and be able to generate art. This would be interesting to be compared to standard methods of generating computational art such as the ones that utilize different fundamentals such as the ones we discussed in class, while also learning more about how certain models such as Markov Chains affect the probaility in different states of models and affect the outcome. ~~

~~I will try to do this by exploring which different GANs can be used to produce and fine tune image generation. I will use an available dataset like the one below in order to train my model. This will be challenging since I have never used GANs before and it will be a new opportunity to apply mathematical principles in a network to use. ~~

## Another possible project with GAN

### General Idea

Another possible project is using CycleGAN on a Pokemon dataset. I could either scrape this data or use some of the already available datasets to generate new Pokemons with different types (fire, electric, water etc.). This would be trained based on the stub code given by the CycleGAN paper and then changed in order to be able to work on the dataset provided. 

### Evaluation

I would evaulate the results by generating 3 different Pokemons with different types than they originally belong to. I will also try to generate a new Pokemon and see if it looks like a possible new creature.
