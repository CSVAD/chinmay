# Final Project Proposal

For the final project, I would love to explore the generative artwork topic. I loved thinking about and researching all kinds of various artforms people have created using multiple stimulants as well as an array of technological tools including ML. Some of the artworks discussed in the class were very interesting to look at that used basic recursion as well as randomness to generate something beautiful. 

I'm interested in exploring something similar where I can provide a dataset of real world images and be able to generate art. This would be interesting to be compared to standard methods of generating computational art such as the ones that utilize different fundamentals such as the ones we discussed in class, while also learning more about how certain models such as Markov Chains affect the probaility in different states of models and affect the outcome.
