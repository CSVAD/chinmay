# Week 5 

I wanted to build up on top of the different examples we saw this week. But a lot of these examples were standalong things that could be combined to build a more robust drawing tool. So I decided I will try to give the user more freedom and options of what they wanted to make and create a tool that combined a lot of what we saw last week. 

This weeks work contains a simple drawing tool that is capable of drawing lines, reflecting lines, triangles and circles. All of these options can be controlled in terms of color and size. As well as options to create PDFs using the DrawingManager library.
