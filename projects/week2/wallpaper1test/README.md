# The Happy Skull

I wanted to try something that was a mix between uniformity and randomness. I found this vector graphic that I really liked and thought having a repeating but kind of randomized pattern might look good. However, with a lot of tries it was clear that this was meant to be by itself. So I represented the randomness and the repetition with the elipse in the background that give a more mordern art design while having a symbolic skull as the center of the wallpaper. I also added edges to the 4 corners by rotating the arc the appropriate amount to give a sense of edges. The colors are randomized when the wallpaper is ran which means each time there will be a different pallet values for RGB colors making this a bit dynamic.
