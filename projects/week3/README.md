# 3D Lantern

I started off by following the example shown in class and trying to explore what could be done with a different shape and how I could introduce a bit of a random pattern. I thought about what choices I wanted the user to have and what choices users should not be able to change. After trying to add and remove some constraints I realized that giving the user a choice for the shape was something that could change and create something a bit different each time. With this I also gave them the choice to change resolution, amplitude, frequency and the height of the object. I added the height of the object as static. Using these degrees of freedom it's possible to create a lot of different designs some of which represent a more traditional paper lantern shape while some can look like a ribbon.
